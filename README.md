1.I take an image in gray scale (we can also take image color and it the app convert to gray scale it self).
2. In this step we encrypt the image by someone in the list 
3. In this step we decrypt the image, by the protocols:
 DSA: to setect if the user is the user.
 Xtea to encrypt the key of the hellman knapsack.
 Hellman knapsack is crate the key of our problem.
OFB to choose a specific stream mode to move the bigger data.
